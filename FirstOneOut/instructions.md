# First Mix Out

This is a really simple game you can play with 2 or more players.

## Game

Placing the cards Question up, deal 4 cards for everyone, and place the rest of deck in the middle. No player should look at the answers, however each player can align the cards so they're all visible.

The player to the left of the dealer starts.

On your turn, you can either:

1.  Select one of your cards you wish to answer and say the answer out loud. Turn the card over to show the answer. Place the card answer face up next to the deck.

    - If you answer incorrectly, you must pick up another card from the top deck and add it to your hand.

    - If you answer correctly, you are now free to swap one of your existing cards with another player, or the deck if you wish.

2. Swap one of your cards with the top card from the deck.

Now it is the next players turn.

The winner is the first player to get rid of all their cards.

## Variations

 - Try more than 4 cards per person.
 - Try pickup 2 cards on error (this is really hard).
